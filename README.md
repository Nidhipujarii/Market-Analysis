About The Project
CodeX is a German beverage company(imaginary) that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market.

Just a few months ago, they boldly introduced their signature drink to ten vibrant Indian cities. And to know their customers better they conducted survey and they got response from 10k customers.

Now my role as a marketing analyst is to analyze survey results and provide insights to marketing team.
